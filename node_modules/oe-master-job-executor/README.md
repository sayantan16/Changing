## Need
In a clustered environment, a boot script would run on all instances of the application, as the cluster comes up.
However, irrespective of the number of application-instances in the cluster, sometimes there is a need to execute an
arbitrary function just once, on a single application instance, at the time of application-cluster startup;
and later, if the application instance that executed the one-time function goes down for any reason, another running
instance needs to take over and run the function.

An example would be the case of a function that sends "application is up" heartbeat event at regular intervals.
Such a function, if started from a regular boot script, would start multiple timers sending extra/unwanted heartbeat events
depending on the number of app-instances in the cluster. This calls for a module that can run the function only
once on a single app-instance of the cluster. If the function-runner instance goes down, the function should be run again on another
active app-instance.

Another example: A clustered application may be running 4 application instances, but a *job scheduler function* within this app
may need to run once on boot, and only on a single app instance. The app instance which is elected to run the *job-scheduler function*
is the *job-scheduler-master* instance.
If the *job-scheduler-master* instance goes down, then another instance of the application should become the *job-scheduler-master* and
run the *job scheduler function*.

## Implementation
This module provides the infrastructure for catering to the above need. It is implemented as an **app-list** module for **oe-Cloud** based applications.
It provides the ability to automatically elect one app-instance from among the cluster-instances and run a specified function once in the elected app-instance,
which we call the <FUNCTION_>MASTER instance, for e.g., JOB_SCHEDULER_MASTER instance. If the master for a function goes down,
a new master is elected for that function and the function is run again.

To achieve the aforementioned functionality, a database query/update-based locking is used, along with updates of a lock *heartbeat* timestamp
at regular intervals by the master app-instance. All app-instances keep checking for missed master-heartbeats and are ready to take over
as master by deleting the lock from the database and creating their own lock.

<a name="Setup"></a>
## Setup
To get the *oe-master-job-executor* feature in the application, the **oe-master-job-executor** node module needs to be added
as a *package.json* dependency in the application.

Also, the module needs be added to the `server/app-list.json` file in the app.

For e.g.,

**package.json**  (only part of the file is shown here, with relevant section in **bold**):

<pre>
...
   ...
   "dependencies": {
       ...
       ...
       ...
       "oe-workflow": "^2.0.0",
       <B>"oe-master-job-executor": "^2.0.0",</B>
       "passport": "0.2.2",
       ...
       ...
</pre>

**server/app-list.json**   (Relevant section in **bold**):

<pre>
[
    {
        "path": "oe-cloud",
        "enabled": true
    },
    <b>{
        "path": "oe-master-job-executor",
        "enabled": true
    },</b>
	{
		"path" : "oe-workflow",
		"enabled" : true
	},
	{
        "path": "./",
        "enabled": true
    }
]
</pre>

<a name="Usage"></a>
## Usage
The *oe-master-job-executor* module can be used to start any number of *masters*, for performing various one-time-run functions/operations.
Each such usage creates one *master*. Creation of a *master* involves providing a **lockName** for the *master* and a **masterJob** object which
has the one-time-run function to execute, as shown below:

```javascript

function start() {
    // Start the master function
}

function stop() {
    // Stop/cleanup the master function
}

var masterJobExecutor = require('oe-master-job-executor');
var options = {
                  lockName: 'JOB-SCHEDULER',                  // Mandatory
                  masterJob: { start: start, stop: stop },    // Mandatory
                  checkMasterInterval: 60000                  // Optional. See 'Configuration' section below for details.
              };
masterJobExecutor.startMaster(options);


```
The above code can run, say, from a boot script in all app-instances of an application cluster, however, the function **start()** will be called only once
on one of the app-instances (the master). If the master instance dies, **start()** will be called again once on another instance that is elected as master.

The **stop()** function is called whenever the master is stopped either due to manual disablement via HTTP API call (see **Control** section below),
or self-stoppage due to heartbeat timestamp not getting updated for any reason.

<a name="Configuration"></a>
## Configuration
The *oe-master-job-executor* module can be configured via -

1.  Default values in code (no configuration)
2.  server/config.json
3.  environment variables
4.  startMaster options (see **Usage** section above)

with the following priority:  4 > 3 > 2 > 1

Priority is applicable on a per-parameter basis.

The following are the configuration parameters:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                                                                   app-instance checks for the master heartbeat
                                                                                                                   in order to try and become master itself

An example of *oe-master-job-executor* configuration via **server/config.json** is shown below:

```javascript

{
    . . .
    . . .
    "masterJobExecutor": {
        "initDelay": 5000,
        "checkMasterInterval": 20000
        "heartbeatInterval": 15000,
        "maxHeartbeatRetryCount": 10
    },
    . . .
    . . .
}
```

<a name="Control"></a>
## Control
The master can be stopped and started manually via HTTP API. Disabling the master causes the current master to call the
**stop()** function of the *masterJob* and it will also prevent other app-instances from becoming a master.

The API to call for stopping/disabling the master is as follows:
```
POST /api/mastercontrols/disable
```
e.g., payload:
```json
{
    "lockName": "JOB-SCHEDULER",
    "reason": "testing"
}

```

The API for restarting/enabling the master is as follows:
```
POST /api/mastercontrols/enable
```
e.g., payload:
```json
{
    "lockName": "JOB-SCHEDULER"
}

```
Upon restarting/re-enabling a master, one of the running app-instances will get elected as master and the *masterJob*'s **start()** function is called once.
