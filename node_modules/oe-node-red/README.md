## Introduction
**Node-RED** has been a feature of *oe-cloud* framework for some time now, and it has been widely adopted for its extreme ease of use.
In order to take advantage of new features introduced in newer versions of *Node-RED*, we need to be able to upgrade *Node-RED* easily and seamlessly.
To this end, *Node-RED* has been separated from the core *oe-cloud* framework and the *Node-RED* integration is now implemented as an
optional "app-list" module for the *oe-cloud*-based app. This new module is called **oe-node-red**.

<a name="About the module"></a>
## About the module
**oe-node-red** is a nodejs module for *Node-RED* integration with *oe-Cloud*, and this module is the only dependency required by an
*oe-Cloud* based application to get the *Node-RED* feature.

This module adds a *loopback* boot-script for starting *Node-RED* as part of the *loopback* app boot-up. It also adds a few loopback models to the app for managing Node-RED data.

The *oe-node-red* module also manages other dependencies like [**oe-node-red-nodes**](https://github.com/EdgeVerve/oe-node-red-nodes), and *Node-RED* itself.
As of now, the *Node-RED* dependency version is changed from 16.x to 18.x, which has various improvements over its predecessors.

**Note**:

Unlike previous iterations of *Node-RED* integration in oe-Cloud, now *Node-RED* flows are saved to database irrespective of whether the app is in production mode
or not. Flows are also saved to `{userDir}/{flowFile}` in parallel. This is to enable source-control of flow data, as well as to aid initial data seeding
in production.

<a name="How to add Node-RED feature in oe-cloud -based app"></a>
## How to add Node-RED feature in oe-cloud -based app?

To get the *Node-RED* feature in the application, the **oe-node-red** node module needs to be added
as a *package.json* dependency in the application.

Also, the module needs be added to the `server/app-list.json` file in the app.

For e.g.,

<pre>
package.json  (only part of the file is shown here, with relevant section in bold):


   ...
   ...
   "dependencies": {
       ...
       ...
       ...
       <b>"oe-node-red": "git+https://github.com/EdgeVerve/oe-node-red.git#2.0.0",</b>
       ...
       ...

</pre>

<pre>
server/app-list.json   (Relevant section in bold):

[
    {
        "path": "oe-cloud",
        "enabled": true
    },
    <b>{
        "path": "oe-node-red",
        "enabled": true
    },</b>
	. . .
	. . .
]
</pre>


<a name="Configuration"></a>
### Configuration

The *oe-node-red* module is configured from two files -

* server/config.json
* server/node-red-settings.js

<a name="config.json settings"></a>
#### server/config.json settings

The *oe-node-red* configuration settings in the application's `config.json` are used for high level control, like enabling/disabling *Node-RED*,
enabling and setting up Node-RED-admin roles, etc.,

All *oe-node-red* configuration parameters in this file are optional.

The following are the *oe-node-red* configuration settings possible in the application's `server/config.json` file:
<pre>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
setting                  type           default (if not defined)  Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
disableNodered           boolean        false                     Use this to turn off Node-RED (despite having the *oe-node-red* module)
                                                                  by setting this parameter to true. Default is false, i.e., Node-RED is
                                                                  enabled by default. See notes below for corresponding environment variable.

enableNodeRedAdminRole   boolean        false                     Use this to allow only users having certain roles to access the Node-RED UI
                                                                  by setting this parameter to true. Default is false, which allows all users
                                                                  access to Node-RED UI.

nodeRedAdminRoles        string array   ["NODE_RED_ADMIN"]        Use this to setup the names of the roles which have access to the Node-RED UI.
                                                                  This setting is used only if enableNodeRedAdminRole is true.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>

<a name="node-red-settings.js"></a>
#### server/node-red-settings.js

The application's `server/node-red-settings.js` supports the same parameter settings as *Node-RED's* [`settings.js` file](https://nodered.org/docs/configuration).

*If this file is present, parameters from this file are merged and prioritized over the sane default values mentioned below and the result is taken as Node-RED configuration*

**Thus, this file can be used to override the Node-RED configuration defaults provided in code**


Some of the important settings possible in this file are documented here: https://nodered.org/docs/configuration

A sample `server/node-red-settings.js` file is provided below:

```javascript
module.exports = {                                  // All defaults mentioned below are applicable only
                                                    // if this file (server/node-red-settings.js) is **not present**

  httpRequestTimeout: 120000,                       // default: not set
  httpAdminRoot: '/red',                            // default: /red
  httpNodeRoot: '/redapi',                          // default: /redapi
  userDir: 'nodered/',                              // default: nodered/
  nodesDir: '../nodes',                             // default: ../nodes
  flowFile: 'node-red-flows.json',                  // default: 'node-red-flows.json'
  flowFilePretty: true,                             // default: true
  functionGlobalContext: {                          // default: {
    loopback: require('loopback'),                  //            loopback: require('loopback'),
    logger: require('oe-logger')('node-red-flow')   //            logger: require('oe-logger')('node-red-flow')
  }                                                 //          }
}

```

This file (`server/node-red-settings.js`) in the application is optional. In its absence, sane defaults as mentioned above are provided by the *oe-node-red* module.


<a name="Notes"></a>
#### Notes

As mentioned above, *Node-RED* integration can be disabled from the `server/config.json`. It can also be disabled by
setting the environment variable:
```console
DISABLE_NODE_RED=true   (or 1)
```

If `server/node-red-settings.js` is not present, the defaults that are provided are as in the comments above.

As noted earlier, *Node-Red* flows are saved to database whether the app is in production mode or not. A flow data file is also
persisted to `{userDir}/{flowFile}`. If **production** mode is enabled by setting the environment variable `NODE_ENV` to `production`,
then the flows won't be persisted to file. Thus, flows would only be saved to database in production.

During development, the flow data file persisted at `{userDir}/{flowFile}` contains data in the same format as the database table
holding flows (`NodeRedFlow` table). So this file can be used directly for initial seeding of data in production.

<a name="Migration from oe-cloud"></a>
## Migration from oe-cloud v 1.2.0/1.3.0/1.4.0
In this new implementation of *Node-RED* integration, flow-nodes are now stored as separate records, one record per node.
A record of a node looks like this:

```json
{
    "id"   :    "7b279bd6.7b9064",
    "node" :    {
                    "id" : "7b279bd6.7b9064",
                    "type" : "mqtt in",
                    "z" : "8a31d1.1fd8ce3",
                    "name" : "",
                    "topic" : "testtopic",
                    "qos" : "2",
                    "broker" : "5e5886e3.30a7d8",
                    "x" : 190,
                    "y" : 160,
                    "wires" : [ [ ] ]
                }
}
```
So, a flow that contains 10 nodes would be stored as 10 records plus an extra node of type "tab", making a total of 11 records
in the database (Any configuration nodes will add more nodes). This is in contrast to the earlier (*oe-cloud v 1.2.0/1.3.0/1.4.0*) implementation
where all flows (and their nodes) were stored as a single record in the database. The old storage format will not work with
the new *Node-RED* integration implementation.

To address this, the following migration strategy can be adopted:

1. Before upgrading to the new *oe-Cloud* that includes the new *Node-RED* integration implementation, Login to your application with the old *Node-RED* implementation and open the *Node-RED* UI.
2. Select a tab, Do "Select All" using "Ctrl+A", and export the current tab's flows to the clipboard using the ``Menu --> Export --> Clipboard`` option.
3. Save the contents of the clipboard to a local file, using a filename which is the same as the tab name.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for all tabs in your *Node-RED* interface, at the end of which you should have as many local files as there are tabs in your *Node-RED* UI.
5. Delete all your *Node-RED* flow-data from the **NodeRedFlow** table in the application database.
6. Upgrade to the latest version of oe-cloud which includes the new implementation of *Node-RED* integration (Follow instructions from **How to add Node-RED feature in oe-cloud -based app?** section above).
7. Login to your application and open the new *Node-RED* UI
8. Import the flows from each of the files created in step 3 back into *Node-RED*, naming the tabs the same as the filename, using the ``Menu --> Import --> Clipboard`` option
9. Run a sanity test on your flows.
10. Optional: At the end of the import, you should have a `{userDir}/{flowFile}` file containing all flow data as an array of nodes. Use this file to commit to source-control and for initial data seeding in production environment.
